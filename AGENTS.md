## Git conventions

- Keep commits atomic. Don't introduce something broken or incorrect and fix it in a follow-up commit within the same PR.
- Do not include coding session URLs in commit messages.

## CI/CD

- Pipeline failures are **critical** and must be resolved before any other work proceeds.
- All tests must pass before a PR can be merged.
